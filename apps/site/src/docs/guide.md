The [Playground](/zpl-js/) is a ZPL editor, previewer, and label printer
emulator (with the `zpl-js-listener`). 
- There are a number of label presets that showcase the capabilities of the ZPL II language. 
- Within the editor, you can hover over ZPL commands for descriptions and help text.
- By toggling **live print** mode, you can preview labels sent from any app or device over HTTP Post.
