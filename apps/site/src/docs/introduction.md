# Introduction

**ZPL × JS** is a library for working with the ZPL II barcode label printing language in TypeScript and JavaScript.
Some of the features include:
- **Browser code editor** with highlighting, hover tips, and live preview. (Try the [Playground](/zpl-js/) and [related docs](/zpl-js/?redirect=/docs/playground/guide))
- **Printer emulator for HTTP Post** using the `zpl-js-listener`, so you can develop without a physical printer! (See the [Live print section](/zpl-js/?redirect=/docs/playground/live-print)).
- **React SDK** for defining barcode label templates with dynamic data and printing via HTTP Post. (See the [API section](/zpl-js/?redirect=/docs/api-reference/overview))

Specifically, this library includes a ZPL II parser, renderer, code editor, HTTP-to-WebSocket utility, and a set of React hooks. It's free and open source and runs entirely in the browser!
